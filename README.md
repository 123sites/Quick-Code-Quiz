# ⭐ Quick-Code-Quiz ⭐ # 

## Description ✏️

This was a challenge where I had to create a multiple choice, timed code quiz.  It had to run in the browser and needed to feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by JavaScript code.  There needed to be a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

The functions that it needed were:
1) When the start button is clicked, the timer starts when presented with a question.
2) Points subtracted when there is a wrong answer.
3) When either all questions are answered or when the timer reaches 0, the game is over.
4) When the game is over, initials and score are saved.
